I use this repo to hold my design for insight a menu initially made for redengine(Not macho btw rico) in fivem. 
I felt the need to write this after RICOMODZ on discord used my design bar for bar to the point I'd like to say he stole it he didnt even change the colorðŸ¤¦.
Also a message to you Rico you could've tracked down my discord and asked and I would've told you what I say below VVV its not too hard js so yk for future reference its "Blupillcosby".
To People Who'd Like To Use My Design Please Change The Color, Icons, And Option Names Its Not Hard.
Also rico i hand made the world and server svg by hand so its for surly my design you took.
